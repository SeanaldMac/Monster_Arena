# Monster_Arena
Solo project done in Unity (C#) that I did for a month. The game is about a small controllable character that faces off against massive boss enemies (currently only one). With this concept, I coded the core mechanics for the player which was movement and a weapon attack. Currently, if you get hit once you lose, but that can be easily changed later. As for the boss mechanics, I coded his initial spawn of him rising from the floor and also attacks for him which are used in attack patterns that uses the Random.Range method to choose which attack. Additionally, I was able to change attack patterns at a 50% health threshold, meaning that I could build upon having multiple phases in the future. Lastly, the end scene was just for fun.
